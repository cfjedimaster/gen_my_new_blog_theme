I want to create a new theme for my blog. My blog is developer-centric. My theme should consist of one main HTML file, one CSS file, and minimal if any JavaScript. (You can create an empty JS file and include it though if you wish.)

Absolutely NO framework must be used. Absolutely no React, or Vue, or anything, and no build process. I literally just want static HTML and CSS. 

I want a dark green centric theme as green is my favorite color. 

The theme should be responsive and look on mobile devices.

The main page you create should include a title for the blog and 10 blog entries listed in reverse chronological order. Each blog post should include a date.

The top level menu should include a links to: Home, About, Speaking (I'm a frequent speaker at conferences), Subscribe. You can also include a link to a search page, or perhaps a small search field. 

Finally, using this template, create a page for an individual blog post. That template should include a date and a list of categories associated with the blog post.
